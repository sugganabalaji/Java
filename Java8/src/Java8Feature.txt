Java 8 introduced significant features that revolutionized how developers write Java code, primarily by bringing functional programming paradigms to the language. Key features include:

Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces:
---------------------------------------------
Lambda expressions provide a concise syntax for implementing functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method), enabling more compact and readable code for tasks like event handling and collection processing.

Stream API:
-----------
A powerful API for performing bulk data operations on collections, arrays, and other data sources. It supports functional-style operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing, allowing for efficient and expressive data manipulation.

Default and Static Methods in Interfaces:
-----------------------------------------
Default methods allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations, promoting backward compatibility. Static methods in interfaces provide utility methods directly associated with the interface.

Java Time API (Date and Time API):
----------------------------------
A modern, immutable, and thread-safe API for handling dates and times, addressing shortcomings of the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes. It includes classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, and ZonedDateTime.

Optional Class:
---------------
A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps in handling potential null values more explicitly and safely, reducing the likelihood of NullPointerExceptions.

forEach() method in Iterable interface:
---------------------------------------
Provides a convenient way to iterate over elements of collections, often used in conjunction with lambda expressions.

Method References:
------------------
A shorthand for lambda expressions that simply call an existing method, improving code readability when the lambda expression's body is a single method call.

Nashorn JavaScript Engine:
--------------------------
A JavaScript engine integrated into the JVM, allowing for the execution of JavaScript code within Java applications.

Concurrency API Improvements:
-----------------------------
Enhancements to the java.util.concurrent package, including CompletableFuture for asynchronous programming.
