Java 8 introduced significant features that revolutionized how developers write Java code, primarily by bringing functional programming paradigms to the language. Key features include:

Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces:
---------------------------------------------
Lambda expressions provide a concise syntax for implementing functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method), enabling more compact and readable code for tasks like event handling and collection processing.
Questions:
---------
-> Explain the concept of functional interfaces and their role with lambda expressions.
-> Discuss the advantages of using lambda expressions over anonymous inner classes.
-> Provide examples of using lambda expressions with various functional interfaces (e.g., Predicate, Consumer, Function, Supplier).

Stream API:
-----------
A powerful API for performing bulk data operations on collections, arrays, and other data sources. It supports functional-style operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing, allowing for efficient and expressive data manipulation.
Questions:
----------
-> Explain the benefits of using the Stream API for data processing.
-> Differentiate between intermediate and terminal operations in streams.
-> Discuss the differences between sequential and parallel streams and when to use each.
-> Provide examples of common stream operations like filter, map, reduce, collect, sorted, distinct.
-> Discuss performance considerations and potential pitfalls when using streams.

Default and Static Methods in Interfaces:
-----------------------------------------
Default methods allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations, promoting backward compatibility. Static methods in interfaces provide utility methods directly associated with the interface.
Questions:
----------
-> Explain the purpose and implications of default methods in interfaces.
-> Discuss scenarios where default methods are useful, particularly for backward compatibility.

Java Time API (Date and Time API):
----------------------------------
A modern, immutable, and thread-safe API for handling dates and times, addressing shortcomings of the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes. It includes classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, and ZonedDateTime.
Questions:
----------
-> Discuss the improvements and advantages of the new Date and Time API over the older java.util.Date and Calendar classes.
-> Demonstrate usage of classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Instant, Period, and Duration.

Optional Class:
---------------
A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps in handling potential null values more explicitly and safely, reducing the likelihood of NullPointerExceptions.
Questions:
----------
-> Explain the purpose of the Optional class and how it helps in handling null values.
-> Demonstrate its usage with methods like isPresent(), orElse(), orElseGet(), map(), flatMap().

forEach() method in Iterable interface:
---------------------------------------
Provides a convenient way to iterate over elements of collections, often used in conjunction with lambda expressions.

Method References:
------------------
A shorthand for lambda expressions that simply call an existing method, improving code readability when the lambda expression's body is a single method call.

Nashorn JavaScript Engine:
--------------------------
A JavaScript engine integrated into the JVM, allowing for the execution of JavaScript code within Java applications.

Concurrency API Improvements:
-----------------------------
Enhancements to the java.util.concurrent package, including CompletableFuture for asynchronous programming.
Questions:
----------
-> Discuss how Java 8 features like CompletableFuture and parallel streams can be used for concurrent programming.
-> Explain the Fork/Join framework and its relation to parallel streams.

Functional Programming Principles:
----------------------------------
-> Discuss how Java 8 promotes functional programming paradigms.
-> Explain concepts like immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions in the context of Java 8.

Refactoring Legacy Code:
------------------------
-> Discuss strategies for refactoring existing Java codebases to leverage Java 8 features.

Performance Optimization:
-------------------------
-> Discuss how to optimize performance when using streams and other Java 8 features.
-> Identify potential performance bottlenecks and how to address them.

Real-world Scenarios and Problem Solving:
-----------------------------------------
-> Solve complex programming problems using Java 8 features, such as data aggregation, filtering, transformation, and statistical analysis on collections.
-> Design and implement solutions that demonstrate a clear understanding of when and how to apply specific Java 8 constructs.
